			<h1 id="C1">What is chocolate?</h1>
				<p>Chocolate is the most popular sweet treat in the world. According to the World Cocoa Foundation, more than 3 million tons of cocoa beans are consumed by people around the world. Chocolate was once considered more valuable than gold dust.</p>

				<img src = "bean.jpg" width = "200" height = "200" alt = ""/><img src = "arrow.png" width = "200" height = "200" alt = "" /><img src = "bar.png" width = "200" height = "200" alt = "" />
					<p>Chocolate is made from the fruit of Theobroma Cacao, which means “food of the gods”. The tree is native to native to the tropical regions of America. Cacao trees bear fruit, known as cacao pods are full of up to 50 beans. These beans are then crushed, there fats and solid are remaining. The fat are called cocoa butter and the solids are ground into cocoa butter.</p>
					<ol>
						
						<li>Harvesting: Cocoa beans are harvested near the equator.</li>
						<img src = "harvest.png" width = "300" height = "200" alt = "Cocoa production world map."/>
						<li>The cacao beans are transported to the factory. At the chocolate factory, the cacao beans are filtered. Then the beans are weighed and sorted by type.</li>
						<img src = "sorting.jpg" width = "300" height = "200" alt = "Workers sorting cacoa beans in a chocolate factory."/>
						<li>Roasting: Cacao beans are roasted in large, rotating ovens to release the flavour. The roasting last from half an hour to one hour, with longer roasting bringing out more subtle flavour.</li>
						<img src = "roasting.jpg" width = "300" height = "200" alt = "Chocolate making factory worker putting cocoa beans into a roaster."/>
						<li>Winnowing: cacao beans are then placed into a machine that takes away the shell of the bean and just leaves the meaty interiors, the nibs.</li>
						<img src = "winnowing.jpg" width = "300" height = "200" alt = "A blue winnowing machine."/>
						<li>Milling: The nibs are crushed and ground into chocolate liquor.</li>
						<img src = "milling.jpg" width = "300" height = "200" alt = "Cocoa beans milling."/>
						<li>Pressing: The chocolate liqueur is slammed by a huge hydraulic press. This process removes the cocoa butter, and what’s left of the chocolate liquor can be ground into cocoa.</li>
						<img src = "hydrolic.jpg" width = "300" height = "200" alt = "Cocoa beans pressing with hydraulic press."/>
						<li>Refinning: The mix is then flattened into a paste using rollers.</li>
						<img src = "pressing.jpg" width = "300" height = "200" alt = "The mix getting flattenied with rollers."/>
						<li>Conching: The paste runs through a machine that mixes and kneads it. Conching can last a few hours for cheaper chocolates and up to a week for expensive chocolate!</li>
						<img src = "refinning.jpg" width = "300" height = "200" alt = "Conching machine."/>
						<li>Tempering: The chocolate is then tempered by heating it, cooling it and reheating it again. This will give our chocolate a nice glossy look and make the chocolate breakable.</li>
						<img src = "tempering.jpg" width = "300" height = "200" alt = "Chocolate getting tempered.."/>
						<li>Moulding: The chocolate paste can now be moulded into any shape.</li>
						<img src = "moulding.jpg" width = "300" height = "200" alt = "Moulding chocolate."/>
						<li>Finally, we have some tasty chocolate! The chocolate is cooled, packaged and sent on its way to stores.</li>

				<h2 id="C3">History of chocolate</h2>
					<p>Before the 1600, chocolate only existed in Mesoamerica. The people of Mesoamerica had learned to prepare the beans of the native cacao tree. The earliest records show that the beans were grounded and mixed with cornmeal and chilli peppers to create a bitter drink.</p>

					<img src = "drink.jpg" width = "300" height = "300" alt = ""/>
					<p>The word chocolate is derived the mayan word ‘chocol’, meaning hot drink. The Mesoamericians believed that the cocoa was a heavenly food gifted to humans by a serpent god. Aztec used cacao beans as currency and drank chocolate at royal feasts, and even gave it to soldiers as a reward for success in battle and used it in rituals.</p>
                    <img src = "currency.png" width = "819" height = "461" alt = "" class="center"/>
					<p>In 1519, the spanish arrived in Mesoamerica, the Aztec king gave ‘Hernas Cortes’, a Spanish Conquistador and his fellow men 50 jugs of the drink. The colonists returned with shipments of the bean to Spain, where it quickly became popular.</p>

					<p>Throughout the 18th century, chocolate was a fashionable drink for rich Europeans. The fashionable drink was time consuming to produce on a large scale.</p>
					<p>The Mesoamericians were forced to farm most of the cacao plantations by the Spanish colonizers. A large number of indeginous people began to die from diseases brought by Europeans, this resulted in enslaved Africains being brought to make up the label shortages. They planted, maintained and harvested cacao beans throughout the Caribean, South America and Central America.</p>
					<img src = "africans.jpg" width = "304" height = "300" alt = ""class="center"/>
					<p>But this all changed in 1828, when Coenraad Van Houten of Amsterdam created the cocoa press. His invention separated cocoa butter from chocolate liquor. This led to the creation of cocoa powder and solid chocolate.</p>
					<img src = "press.jpg" width = "304" height = "267" alt = ""class="center"/>
					<p>In 1847, a Swiss chocolatier named Daniel Peter invented milk chocolate by adding powdered milk to the mix.</p>
					<img src = "peter.jpeg" width = "295" height = "389" alt = ""class="center"/>
					<p>By the 1900, chocolate was no longer considered a luxury item but had become a treat for the public.</p>
					
					
				<h2 id="C4">Different types of chocolate</h2>
					<p>Chocolate-you know you love it but do you know the different kinds of chcolate?</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Dark chocolate is a form of chocolate containing chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, sugar, lecithin, vanilla and without the milk found in milk chocolate.</li>
						<img src = "dark.jpg" width = "304" height = "223" alt = ""/><img src = "lindt.png" width = "304" height = "300" alt = ""/>
						<li>Milk chocolate contains all the above ingredients dark chocolate plus milk fats and milk solids.</li>
						<img src = "milk.jpg" width = "304" height = "203" alt = ""/><img src = "diary.jpg" width = "304" height = "304" alt = ""/>
						<li>White chocolate is technically not really chocolate as it doesn’t contain chocolate liquor, but it does contain everything milk chocolate does.</li>
